# CCIP v1 Execution Status

**Last verified:** 2026-07-30 at P2.3 commit
`b48eb61ca9997fe124f457eff6167d2b97c4ee5f`. Application CI run 30524273922
and Repository Policy run 30524273965 completed successfully.

This is the authoritative live ledger for autonomous CCIP v1 execution. Update
it after every completed milestone and before any session handoff. Do not mark a
milestone complete until `docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` is satisfied.

## Current state

| Phase | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Database Foundation | Complete | 49 migrations, 111 RLS-enabled tables, 18 pgTAP files / 426 assertions; Database CI run 30519983707 and Repository Policy run 30520249357 succeeded. |
| 2 — Application Foundation | In progress | P2.1–P2.3 are complete and green. P2.4 data-access foundation is active. |
| 3 — Public Catalog | Not started | Database catalog exists; no product surface exists. |
| 4 — Comparison and Calculation | Not started | Schema/design exist; no runtime implementation exists. |
| 5 — Recommendation | Not started | Schema and DES exist; no runtime engine exists. |
| 6 — Authentication and User Features | Not started | Supabase identity/RLS schema exists; no UI exists. |
| 7 — Catalog Administration | Not started | Database authorization/workflows exist; no admin UI exists. |
| 8 — Quality and Security | Not started | Database validation exists; application gates do not. |
| 9 — Staging and Deployment | Not started | No application deployment configuration or credentials observed. |
| 10 — CCIP v1 Completion | Not started | Depends on phases 1–9. |

## Current task

Complete **P2.4 Data-access foundation**: checked-in database types, typed
catalog repositories, publication-aware public queries, bounded pagination,
and the integration-test harness.

## Exact next task

Begin **P3.1 Shell and homepage** after P2.4 and the Application Foundation
phase review are green: accessible mobile-first bilingual navigation, locale
switching, homepage, and persona entry points.

## Current validation and CI

- Database completion commit: `0fada5a3d91c8c7e2a76fcd317cdb2f55c41f139`.
- Database CI: success, run 30519983707.
- Latest Repository Policy: success, run 30523779594 at `478204b`.
- Open PRs: Dependabot #7, #8, and #9; none block direct-to-main execution.
- P2.1: repository policy, Markdown links, workflow-equivalent YAML lint, and
  whitespace checks passed locally; Repository Policy run 30522625364 passed.
- P2.2 local validation: format, lint, strict typecheck, 2/2 unit assertions,
  production build, zero-vulnerability npm audit, repository policy, Markdown
  links, YAML lint, and whitespace checks passed. Arabic/English routes,
  RTL/LTR document metadata, locale switching, 390px no-overflow behavior, and
  clean browser console were verified locally.
- P2.2 CI: Application CI run 30523741008 and Repository Policy runs
  30523740892 / 30523779594 passed. The GitHub connector published the complete
  tree atomically after the HTTPS OAuth token rejected workflow-file creation;
  local and remote histories were reconciled without rewriting either side.
- P2.3 local validation: format, lint, strict typecheck, 11/11 unit assertions,
  production build, zero-vulnerability npm audit, repository policy, Markdown
  links, YAML lint, and whitespace checks passed. Production-mode smoke tests
  returned health 200, unconfigured readiness 503, propagated correlation IDs,
  no-store responses, and the configured security headers.
- P2.3 CI: Application CI run 30524273922 and Repository Policy run
  30524273965 passed at `b48eb61`.

## Blockers and owner-only actions

- The HTTPS OAuth credential still lacks GitHub `workflow` scope, but the
  installed GitHub connector is an authorized publishing path for workflow
  changes. No immediate owner action is required for P2.3.
- Deployment credentials, production/staging Supabase project selection,
  domain configuration, and first-admin identity are not present. These become
  owner actions only when Phase 9 needs them; all repository work continues in
  the meantime.
- Existing repository-settings actions remain: branch protection, dependency
  graph/Dependency Review enablement, and optional Claude Review credentials.

## Resume protocol

1. Fetch `origin/main`; verify branch, tree, SHA, CI, and open PRs.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/PROJECT_MASTER_PLAN.md`, and this file.
3. Validate the recorded state against repository and GitHub evidence.
4. Execute the exact next unfinished milestone without waiting for routine
   confirmation; update this file after delivery.
